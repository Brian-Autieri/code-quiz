# Code Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a code quiz so that users can test their knowledge of JavaScript. The goal of this quiz is to get a highscore by answering as many multiple choice questions correctly before the time runs out. When the user clicks on the "Start Quiz" button, they are presented with a series of multiple choice questions and a timer counting down from 75 seconds. When a question is answered correctly, the webpage will display "Correct!" and if the wrong answer is selected, "Wrong!" will appear and deduct 15 seconds from the timer.

## Usage

Users can follow the link to the deployed webpage to access the code quiz. Once on the page, users can click on the "Start Quiz" button to test their knoweledge of JavaScript concepts.
